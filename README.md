PostgreSQL
    - a relational database

SQL
    - structured query language
    - allows you to access and change data with a series of keywords
    - statements need to end in a semicolon 
    - upper case all keywords, data types
    - anything relating to the table itself/ anything you are naming yourself/ columns should be lowercase/snake case
    - although SQL doesn't care about casing, it is for other people  to make it more readable 
    - data types are what constrains the input of data
    - `--` is a comment in SQL
    - VARCHAR text that has constraint on size
	    - 255 is using a good length, but can also be 50 or whatever length you want
    - SERIAL
	    - an integer that automatically adds one that the database handles itself
